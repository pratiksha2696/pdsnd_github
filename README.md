### Project Title
Bikeshare Python Project

### Description
This project analyzes bikeshare data for three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
The Python program allows users to explore data and perform a set of queries, such as:
- Which city has the most popular trip?
- What is the most common month for bike usage?
- How long do trips typically last?
The project uses Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and manipulation.

### Files used
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
This project was inspired by Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
I consulted the official Pandas and NumPy documentation for data analysis techniques and syntax.
